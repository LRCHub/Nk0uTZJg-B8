[00:42.29] I'll always follow you me by your side
[00:47.43] But you can't see I'm alone in this room
[00:50.57] So far away
[00:54.06] But now I feel like I'm reborn (feel like reborn)
[01:00.55] I'll be fine
[01:03.03] 'Cause my heart is signed
[01:08.65] Woo I think I like you again
[01:11.75] Woo I can't you see as a friend
[01:14.90] Woo This is the starting point of a crazy little love
[01:21.46] Woo I think I like you again
[01:24.47] Woo I can't you see as a friend
[01:27.31] Woo This is the starting point of a crazy little love
[01:53.81] 
[01:46.58] I'm laying on my bed
[01:49.35] I watch the sky
[01:52.11] But can't you see that I'm misunderstood
[01:55.23] I'm waiting you
[01:58.81] But now I feel like I'm reborn (feel like reborn)
[02:05.37] I'll be fine
[02:07.89] 'Cause my heart is signed
[02:12.79] Woo I think I like you again
[02:15.99] Woo I can't you see as a friend
[02:18.92] Woo This is the starting point of a crazy little love
[02:25.43] Be close to me by now
[02:28.48] Because I want to see (this crazy love)
[02:31.65] And follow me, we can be free
[02:34.65] Don't leave me, I'm smiling again
[02:51.15] 
[03:03.30] I'll always follow you me by your side
[03:15.59] But now I feel like I'm reborn (feel like reborn)
[03:22.12] I'll be fine
[03:24.78] 'Cause my heart is signed
[03:30.25] Woo I think I like you again
[03:33.12] Woo I can't you see as a friend
[03:35.71] Woo This is the starting point of a crazy little love
[03:42.22] Be close to me by now
[03:45.19] Because I want to see (this crazy love)
[03:48.67] And follow me, we can be free
[03:51.65] Don't leave me, I'm smiling again
